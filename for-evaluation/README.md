### OTHER NOTES
When I first started this I found multiple solutions online immediately.  However I took the time to code my own version of the solution while also commenting out their code to the best of my knowledge to show I was also capable of finding the right tools online and understanding them.  This is the link to the solution I drew inspiration from.

I've included the commented file from this github as:
